## Market Basic Actions
- You can create (mint) new tokens, uploading their image and metadata on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).
If you've created or bought an NFT, you may also sell it by setting a price and paying a listing fee.
When buying an NFT, the price will be transferred to the seller and the listing fee to the NFT Marketplace owner.
It's also possible to cancel a market item, transferring it back to the owner.
